Introduction

Head and neck cancer (HNC) refers to a group of malignant tumours that develop in or around the throat, larynx, nose, sinuses, and oral cavity. As per NCDIR and ICMR, the primary site of head and neck cancer includes the tongue, mouth, tonsil, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, pharynx, and larynx [1,2]. The majority of head and neck cancers, about 90%, are squamous cell carcinomas, which arise from the flat, thin squamous cells lining the inner surfaces of the mouth, nose, and throat [3]. Tobacco and alcohol consumption are the leading risk factors for HNC, with their combined use significantly amplifying the risk due to a synergistic effect that accelerates cancerous cell development. In addition to these, other risk factors include exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly in oropharyngeal cancers, environmental exposure to harmful chemicals, pollutants, and radiation, and a family history of cancer [4,5]. The treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC) depends on factors like the cancer's location, size, type of cells, and the patient's overall health. Common treatments include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Treatment plans are personalized to optimize the patient’s health outcomes. Early detection and treatment are essential for improving survival rates, underscoring the importance of awareness regarding symptoms and risk factors for timely diagnosis and intervention [6].
Head and neck cancers rank 6th globally in terms of incidence, accounting for about 4.75% of all cancer cases. In 2022, an estimated 947,211 cases of HNC were reported worldwide, out of 19.98 million cancer cases, according to GLOBOCAN estimates. These cancers include lip and oral cavity malignancies, salivary glands, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. Among these, cancers of the lip and oral cavity were the most common, with 389,846 cases, followed by laryngeal cancers (189,191 cases) and nasopharyngeal cancers (120,434 cases). This distribution highlights the diversity of head and neck cancers and the geographical differences in their prevalence [7]. According to the Hospital-Based Cancer Registry (HBCR), 2022 report from the Malabar Cancer Centre, head and neck cancers represented 14.39% of all reported malignancies, with 872 cases out of a total of 6,059 cancers, making it the second most common type after digestive organ malignancies. Among these cases, 76.26% (665) were males and 23.74% (207) were females, indicating a significantly higher prevalence in males. Lifestyle factors play a major role, with smoking reported in 32.8% of cases, alcohol consumption in 29.9%, pan chewing in 28.4%, and a family history of cancer in 19.3%. These statistics highlight the importance of addressing preventable risk factors to mitigate the burden of head and neck cancers [8].
Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a major public health concern in India, with it accounting for 26% of all cancer cases in males and 8% in females. India experiences a higher burden of HNC compared to countries like the USA, UK, and Brazil. The northeastern regions report the highest incidence of HNC, with cancers of the mouth being the most common, followed by cancers of the tongue, larynx, hypopharynx, and tonsils. The burden is particularly higher in those aged 60 and above, compared to younger age groups [9]. The incidence and mortality rates of head and neck cancers (HNC) are significantly influenced by demographic factors such as age and gender. Older populations, particularly those aged 60 and above, have higher rates of HNC due to the cumulative effects of risk factors and biological aging. Gender differences are also notable, as men generally have a higher incidence of HNC compared to women. This discrepancy is likely attributed to higher exposure to risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use, which are more prevalent in males. Clinical features, including the tumor stage at diagnosis and the involvement of lymph nodes, are crucial in determining survival outcomes. Tumors detected at more advanced stages, with larger sizes and greater nodal involvement, tend to have poorer prognoses and higher mortality rates, as these characteristics often indicate more aggressive cancer progression. Early detection and staging play a pivotal role in improving survival rates, making it essential to address these clinical factors in managing HNC [10].
Survival analysis is a statistical method commonly used in cancer research to assess the time to an event of interest, such as recurrence, progression, or death. Key methodologies include the Kaplan–Meier (KM) method, log-rank tests, and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. These statistical tools are essential for understanding survival trends, comparing treatment outcomes, and identifying critical prognostic factors in cancer research [11]. Various factors influencing survival outcomes for head and neck cancer patients include demographic characteristics, clinical features, and treatment modalities. Despite advancements in therapy, survival remains a significant concern due to the high risk of recurrence and second primary malignancies, particularly in the head and neck, lungs, and esophagus.
The Kaplan-Meier estimator was created by Edward L. Kaplan and Paul Meier in 1958. It is a non-parametric statistical method widely used to estimate survival functions and analyze time-to-event data. This method provides an insightful graphical representation of survival probabilities over time and effectively handles censored data. It has become a standard approach in clinical and epidemiological research. Kaplan-Meier survival curves help identify differences in survival among various groups based on factors such as age, gender, and tumour stage. This makes it an essential tool for comparing patient outcomes, such as survival rates after treatment and the effectiveness of interventions in clinical trials. By estimating the fraction of individuals who survive specific events such as death or disease recurrence, the Kaplan-Meier method remains a foundational aspect of survival analysis, particularly in studies involving incomplete follow-up data [12].
The Cox proportional hazards model is a widely utilized statistical tool in survival analysis, aimed at exploring the relationship between the time until an event of interest occurs commonly death or failure, and one or more predictor variables. This regression model provides a method to assess how various clinical and demographic factors influence survival times while adhering to the crucial assumption that the effect of these predictor variables on the risk of the event occurring (hazard) remains constant throughout the study. In constructing a Cox model, it is essential to carefully choose relevant predictor variables that will be included in the analysis. To achieve this, researchers often employ variable selection techniques, such as forward selection, which incrementally adds predictors based on their significance, and backward elimination, which starts with all potential predictors and sequentially removes the least significant ones. These methods make the model simpler and help focus on the most important factors. Furthermore, to ensure a balance between model fit and complexity, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is frequently used. The AIC provides a statistical measure that penalizes excessive complexity in the model; therefore, it guides researchers in identifying models that briefly explain the data while avoiding overfitting. By prioritizing only, the most relevant variables based on the AIC, analysts can develop a robust Cox model that accurately reflects the underlying survival data, ultimately leading to more insightful conclusions about the factors influencing survival outcomes [13].
Lasso regression, which stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a valuable method used to manage high-dimensional datasets that have a large number of predictor variables. In scenarios where the number of variables exceeds the number of observations or when multicollinearity among predictors is present, traditional regression techniques may struggle to produce reliable results. The key feature of Lasso regression is its application of a penalty term to the ordinary least squares regression model. This penalty is proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients associated with each predictor. By imposing this constraint, Lasso effectively shrinks the coefficients of less important variables towards zero. As a result, it eliminates unimportant features from the model, effectively conducting variable selection. This dual functionality not only simplifies the model by retaining only the most relevant variables but also helps to prevent overfitting, thereby enhancing the model's accuracy and predictive power [14].
The C-index, also known as the concordance index, and the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) are two important metrics used to evaluate the accuracy of predictive models in survival analysis. The C-index measures the model's ability to correctly rank predictions, indicating how well it distinguishes between survival times. On the other hand, the time-dependent AUC quantifies the model's performance over time by calculating the area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various time points. Together, these metrics provide valuable insights into the reliability and effectiveness of a model's survival predictions over time.
This research study is designed to thoroughly apply various survival analysis techniques, specifically the Kaplan-Meier estimator, the Cox proportional hazards model, and the Lasso-based Cox regression model and to systematically identify significant prognostic factors that influence the outcomes of patients suffering from head and neck cancer who are treated at the Malabar Cancer Centre. By applying these advanced methods, we aim to deepen our understanding of the survival patterns among head and neck cancer patients.
